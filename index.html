        The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket
        league in India, launched in 2008 by the Board of Control for Cricket in
        India (BCCI). It is one of the most popular and widely watched cricket
        leagues in the world. IPL features top Indian and international players
        competing for franchise-based teams representing different cities. The
        league is known for its fast-paced matches, thrilling finishes, and high
        entertainment value. Apart from cricket, IPL also combines sports with
        entertainment, attracting millions of fans globally. It has played a
        major role in discovering young talent and providing a global platform
        for emerging players. Today, IPL is not just a cricket tournament but a
        celebration of passion, teamwork, and sportsmanship.
